# TechGear Plus - Azure Cloud Migration Project

## Business Problem
TechGear Plus is a small electronics retailer experiencing:
- Website crashes during high traffic (sales events)
- Slow page load times on shared hosting
- Unpredictable hosting costs
- Inability to scale for business growth

## Current State
- WordPress + WooCommerce website
- Shared hosting environment
- MySQL database
- ~10,000 monthly visitors (spikes to 50,000 during sales)
- 500 product catalog

## Proposed Azure Solution

**Architecture Components:**
- **Azure App Service** - Host the WordPress site with auto-scaling capabilities
- **Azure Database for MySQL** - Managed database service for better performance and reliability
- **Azure Storage Account** - Store product images and media files
- **Azure CDN** - Cache content globally for faster loading times
- **Application Insights** - Monitor performance and detect issues proactively

**Key Benefits:**
- Auto-scaling automatically handles traffic spikes during sales events
- Managed services reduce maintenance overhead and improve reliability
- CDN improves page load times for global customers
- Built-in monitoring provides visibility into performance issues
- Predictable monthly costs with pay-as-you-scale model

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Eliminate website crashes during high traffic periods
- Improve page load times by 60-70%
- Reduce maintenance requirements for TechGear Plus team
- Provide scalable foundation for business growth

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup
1. Create Resource Group
2. Set up Azure Database for MySQL
3. Configure Azure Storage Account
4. Deploy Azure App Service

### Phase 2: Migration
1. Export current WordPress site and database
2. Import database to Azure Database for MySQL
3. Upload WordPress files to App Service
4. Configure database connections
5. Test functionality

### Phase 3: Optimization
1. Implement Azure CDN for static content
2. Configure auto-scaling rules
3. Set up Application Insights monitoring
4. Performance testing and tuning

### Phase 4: Go-Live
1. DNS cutover
2. SSL certificate setup
3. Final testing
4. Monitoring and support handover

## Cost Estimation
- App Service (S1): ~$73/month
- Azure Database for MySQL (B2s): ~$62/month
- Storage Account: ~$5/month
- CDN: ~$10/month
- Application Insights: ~$5/month

**Total Estimated Monthly Cost: ~$155**
*Significantly lower than current unpredictable hosting costs and includes room for growth*

## Success Metrics
- Website uptime during traffic spikes: Target 99.9%
- Page load time improvement: Target 60-70% reduction
- Cost predictability: Fixed monthly costs vs. variable shared hosting
- Scalability: Ability to handle 5x traffic growth without performance degradation
